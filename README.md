# jestPractice

## Description

This is a simple, command line application that allows the user to input a language, and it will return a number for how many countries in the world speak that language. The point of this, though, is to implement testing functionality with Jest.

## To Run

clone the repository and install dependencies with npm install

To start the application, run npm start

To test, run npm test
